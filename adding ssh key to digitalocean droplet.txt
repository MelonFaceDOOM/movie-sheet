If you lose your ssh key, this is what you do:

1) try to ssh using password
2) if you don't know the password, reset it through digital ocean console
3) try again to ssh with password
4) if you are not prompted for a password, it's because you have to edit a config file on the server
5) edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
6) specifically, change PasswordAuthentication value from no to yes
7) restart the ssh service on the server (sudo service ssh restart)
8) ssh from remote pc with password (ssh root@ip address)
9) generate an ssh key on your remote pc
10) This will create a private key (id_rsa) and a public key (id_rsa.pub).
11) copy the contents of id_rsa.pub to the server's ssh authorized_keys file with:
 type id_rsa | ssh root@68.183.52.128 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
12) ctrl+d to exit ssh 
13) try ssh again; password should no longer be needed.
14) consider undoing step 6.
