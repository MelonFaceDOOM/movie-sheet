Brainstorming Requried testing for scheduling module:

- add several test participants
- add availability for each in a variety of time formats
- unready
- look at summary
- look at summary when everything is empty
- add in some votes
- unvote
- recheck summary
- test with multiple events

summary needs to show votes as separate from ready
might be good to build a new func, maybe in Participant, that will help with identifying if:
	the participant is available at a given time
	the participant has voted for a given time
